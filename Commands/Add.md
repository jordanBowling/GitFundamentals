# git add

When changes have been made inside a got repository that you want to keep, you'll need to use the `git add` command.  

Items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified.  

Generally, you can get away with command `git add .` which will add ALL files and directories that were added, changed, or deleted.  

You can track your changes to sepecific files using `git add file1 file2` which will track specifically file1 and file2.  

You can specify tracking directions with `git add DirectoryName`
